# BrowserTempFileCleanUp
This PowerShell script is designed to clean up temporary files from various internet browsers. 
The idea here is to automate the script using Windows Task Scheduler so you don't have to run it yourself. 
This will also ensure that Browser Temp files are always deleted and never get too large.
This script targets the following browsers:

- Edge
- Firefox
- Chrome
